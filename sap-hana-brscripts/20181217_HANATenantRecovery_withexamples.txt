# User configured options
#
# This script can use Secure User Store Authentication
# Secure User Store requires a key for each instance which must be configured outside
# of this script using hdbuserstore executable (part of hdbclient install).
# See more details in the Secure User Store section below.
#
# To use Secure User Store for SAP HANA authentication select a key prefix.
# This prefix will be combined with the instance number to reference a specific
# key for authentication.  For example, the default prefix is HDB, so for
# HANA instance 00 the script will attempt to use key HDB00 to authenticate.
#
# To create Secure User Store use the following command syntax:
#
# ./hdbuserstore set <key> <host>:3<instance#>15 <user> <password>
# 
# For example, to create keys for instance 00 and 01 on host "hana01"
# using a username "VEEAM" and password "Backup123" run the following commands
# as the OS user that will be running the script to create their secure store:
#
# ./hdbuserstore set HDB00 hana01:30015 VEEAM Backup123
# ./hdbuserstore set HDB01 hana01:30115 VEEAM Backup123
#
# For HANA 2.0 SP1 and higher, which are always installed as multi-tenant databases
# even when a single tenant is in use, you must specify that the connection use
# the port of the SYSTEMDB as follows:
# 
# ./hdbuserstore set HDB00 hana01:30113@SYSTEMDB VEEAM Backup123
#
# For more information about keystore use please refer to the SAP HANA documentation.
#
# Note that it is completely possible for the accounts to be difference for each
# instance.  The HANA account requires BACKUP ADMIN and CATALOG READ system privledges.

# Start this script as <SID>adm or any other user with the right to start hdbsql & to read the keystore.

# connect to HANA SYSTEM DB with hdbsql and then enter \c -d systemdb or hdbsql -U userkey etc
hdbsql -U $hdbuserkey -d SYSTEMDB "alter stop database $tenant;"
